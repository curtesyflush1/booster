# Content Script Scope Isolation

## Overview

The BoosterBeacon browser extension content script has been implemented with comprehensive scope isolation to prevent variable leakage into the global scope of web pages it runs on. This ensures that the extension doesn't conflict with existing page scripts and maintains security best practices.

## Implementation

### IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) Wrapper

The entire content script is wrapped in an IIFE to create an isolated execution scope:

```typescript
(() => {
  'use strict';
  
  // All extension code is contained within this scope
  // Classes, functions, and variables are not accessible globally
  
})(); // End of IIFE - all variables and classes are now isolated
```

### Key Features

1. **Complete Scope Isolation**: All classes, functions, and variables are contained within the IIFE scope
2. **Namespace Management**: Uses unique namespaces to prevent conflicts with host page variables
3. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup on page unload to prevent memory leaks
4. **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents multiple instances from overriding each other

### Isolated Components

The following components are isolated within the IIFE scope:

- `ContentScript` class - Main content script controller
- `ProductDetector` class - Product page detection and parsing
- `CheckoutAssistant` class - Checkout page monitoring
- All utility functions (`log`, `debounce`, `generateId`, etc.)
- All service imports and dependencies

### Namespace Strategy

```typescript
// Use unique namespace to prevent conflicts
const BOOSTER_BEACON_NAMESPACE = '__BoosterBeacon_ContentScript_' + Date.now() + '_' + Math.random().toString(36);

// Ensure we don't pollute the global scope
if (!(window as any)[BOOSTER_BEACON_NAMESPACE]) {
  (window as any)[BOOSTER_BEACON_NAMESPACE] = {
    initialized: false,
    instance: null
  };
  
  // Initialize only once per page
  if (!(window as any)[BOOSTER_BEACON_NAMESPACE].initialized) {
    (window as any)[BOOSTER_BEACON_NAMESPACE].instance = new ContentScript();
    (window as any)[BOOSTER_BEACON_NAMESPACE].initialized = true;
  }
}
```

### CSS Scope Isolation

The content script CSS is also isolated to prevent conflicts:

```css
/* CSS Reset for our components to prevent inheritance from host page */
.booster-beacon-fab,
.booster-beacon-fab *,
.booster-beacon-product-ui,
.booster-beacon-product-ui * {
  all: initial;
  font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, sans-serif !important;
}
```

### Memory Management

```typescript
// Clean up namespace on page unload to prevent memory leaks
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () => {
  delete (window as any)[BOOSTER_BEACON_NAMESPACE];
});
```

## Security Benefits

1. **No Global Pollution**: Extension variables don't leak into the host page's global scope
2. **Conflict Prevention**: Extension code doesn't interfere with existing page scripts
3. **Variable Shadowing Protection**: Host page variables with same names don't affect extension functionality
4. **Memory Leak Prevention**: Automatic cleanup prevents memory accumulation

## Testing

Comprehensive tests verify the scope isolation:

- **Global Scope Pollution Tests**: Verify no extension variables leak to global scope
- **Conflict Prevention Tests**: Ensure extension works correctly even when host page has conflicting variables
- **Memory Management Tests**: Verify proper cleanup on page unload
- **Multiple Instance Tests**: Ensure safe handling of duplicate content script injections

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Strict Mode**: All code runs in strict mode for better error detection
2. **Unique Namespacing**: Time-based and random namespace generation prevents conflicts
3. **Defensive Programming**: Graceful handling of missing dependencies and services
4. **CSS Isolation**: Complete CSS reset and scoping to prevent style conflicts
5. **Event Cleanup**: Proper event listener cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## Files Modified

- `extension/src/content/content.ts` - Main content script with IIFE wrapper
- `extension/src/content/content.css` - CSS with scope isolation
- `extension/tests/content/scopeIsolation.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite

## Verification

Run the scope isolation tests to verify implementation:

```bash
npm test -- tests/content/scopeIsolation.test.ts
```

All tests should pass, confirming that:
- No extension classes or functions leak to global scope
- Extension works correctly with conflicting host page variables
- Memory is properly cleaned up on page unload
- Multiple content script instances are handled safely
