## üîÑ Background Service Architecture

### Service Orchestration
**CronService Scheduling**:
```typescript
// Every 5 minutes - Real-time operations
- Product availability scanning (batch optimized)
- Watch pack maintenance and validation
- Queue processing optimization

// Hourly - Data collection
- Comprehensive price history collection
- Product data snapshots and analysis
- Performance analytics aggregation
- Alert delivery optimization

// Daily (2:30 AM) - Maintenance
- Watch cleanup and validation
- Database optimization and indexing
- Stale data removal and archival
- System health checks and reporting
```

### Availability Polling Architecture
```typescript
interface AvailabilityPollingConfig {
  scanInterval: number;        // 2 minutes default
  batchSize: number;          // 50 products per batch
  maxRetryAttempts: number;   // 3 retries for failures
  rateLimitWindow: number;    // Respect API rate limits
  priorityWeighting: boolean; // Plan-based processing priority
}
```

**Intelligent Processing**:
- **Priority Ordering**: Popularity score ‚Üí recency for optimal scanning
- **Batch Optimization**: Dynamic batch sizing based on system load
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable limits to respect retailer API constraints
- **Error Recovery**: Exponential backoff with circuit breaker patterns

### Plan Priority System
**Hierarchical Weighting**:
```typescript
enum PlanWeights {
  PREMIUM = 10,  // 10x processing priority
  PRO = 5,       // 5x processing priority  
  FREE = 1       // Baseline priority
}
```

**Fair Queue Management**:
- **Weighted Round Robin**: Ensures fair resource allocation across plan tiers
