## [1.1.0] - 2024-08-26

### Added - Retailer Integration System ✨ **MAJOR UPDATE**

#### Core Features
- **Multi-Retailer Support**: Complete integration with 4 major retailers
  - Best Buy (Official API)
  - Walmart (Official API) 
  - Costco (Polite web scraping)
  - Sam's Club (Polite web scraping)

#### Architecture & Resilience
- **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Automatic failure detection and recovery
  - 5 failure threshold before opening circuit
  - 1-minute recovery timeout
  - 3 success threshold to close circuit
- **Rate Limiting Compliance**: Respectful API usage
  - API retailers: 5 requests/minute, 100/hour
  - Scraping retailers: 2 requests/minute, 50/hour (conservative)
  - 2-second minimum delays for scraping politeness

#### Health Monitoring
- **Real-time Health Checks**: Continuous retailer monitoring
  - 5-minute automated health check intervals
  - Response time tracking and success rate monitoring
  - Circuit breaker state reporting
- **Performance Metrics**: Comprehensive analytics
  - Request counts, success rates, error tracking
  - Average response times and rate limit monitoring
  - Circuit breaker trip counts and recovery metrics

#### Error Handling & Recovery
- **Robust Error Management**: Graceful failure handling
  - Exponential backoff retry logic
  - Transient vs permanent error classification
  - Automatic circuit breaker recovery
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed operational insights
  - Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
  - Error categorization and stack trace capture
  - Performance metrics and health status logging

#### Compliance & Ethics
- **Terms of Service Compliance**: Respectful integration practices
  - Official APIs prioritized over scraping
  - Conservative rate limits for web scraping
  - Honest user agent identification
- **Polite Scraping**: Ethical web scraping implementation
  - 2-second minimum delays between requests
  - Robots.txt respect and conservative limits
  - No automated purchasing or checkout functionality

#### Testing & Quality
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Extensive testing suite
  - Rate limiting compliance verification
  - Circuit breaker functionality testing
  - Integration tests with mock retailers
  - Performance and load testing capabilities
- **Mock Integration**: Realistic testing environment
  - Mock retailer services for unit tests
  - Simulated API responses and error conditions
  - Circuit breaker state testing
