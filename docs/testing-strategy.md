- **Purpose**: Test interactions between components, API endpoints, and database operations
- **Coverage Target**: 90%+ for critical user flows
- **Tools**: Supertest, Test Database
- **Location**: `tests/integration/`

### 3. End-to-End Tests (10% of tests)
- **Purpose**: Test complete user workflows from frontend to backend
- **Coverage Target**: All critical user journeys
- **Tools**: Playwright
- **Location**: `tests/e2e/`
