## Drop Forecast Addendum (2025-09)

This release adds a drop‑forecasting pipeline that powers near‑term go‑live windows and shadow probabilities.

- Data sources: `drop_events` (status_change, price_present, url_seen, url_live, in_stock) and `availability_snapshots`.
- ETL: `DropFeatureETLService` aggregates counts, hour histograms, and availability ratios into `model_features`.
- Windows model: `DropWindowModelRunner` trains per‑retailer hour‑of‑day weights from `url_live` and `in_stock` events, saved to `data/ml/drop_window_model.json`.
- API: `GET /api/ml/drop-predictions` returns windows; attaches `shadowProb` if `DROP_CLASSIFIER_SHADOW=true`.
- Admin: “Retrain Drop Windows” button triggers ETL + training; the “Retrain Price Model” button also retrains drop windows by default.

### Configuration
- Set `DROP_CLASSIFIER_SHADOW=true` (dev/staging) to attach `shadowProb` to predicted windows.
- Model paths: `data/ml/drop_window_model.json`, `data/ml/price_model.json`.
