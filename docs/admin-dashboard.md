## Testing Tools

To streamline validation of end-to-end flows, the admin panel includes a dedicated Testing Tools section. These tools surface safe, auditable actions designed for staging and local development. In development (`NODE_ENV=development`), some checks are relaxed to speed iteration; in production, RBAC permissions are strictly enforced and all actions are audited.

### Available Test Actions

- Simulated Purchase
  - Endpoint: `POST /api/admin/test-purchase`
  - Purpose: Queues a simulated auto-purchase job to validate orchestration and reporting without live checkout.
  - Input: `productId`, `retailerSlug`, `maxPrice`, `qty`, `alertAt?`

- Synthetic Restock Alert
  - Endpoint: `POST /api/admin/test-alert/restock`
  - Purpose: Exercises the alert generation and delivery pipeline (email/Discord/web push/SMS).
  - Input: `userId?`, `productId`, `retailerSlug`, `price?`, `productUrl?`, `watchId?`

- Recent Transactions
  - Endpoint: `GET /api/admin/purchases/transactions/recent?limit=50`
  - Purpose: Quickly review recent synthetic or live transactions for verification.

### Admin Utilities

- Set Password by Email
  - Endpoint: `POST /api/admin/users/set-password`
  - Input: `email`, `newPassword`

- Grant Admin Role by Email
  - Endpoint: `POST /api/admin/users/grant-admin`
  - Input: `email`

- Lookup User by Email
  - Endpoint: `GET /api/admin/users/by-email?email=user@example.com`

All testing actions emit audit logs with actor, payload summary, and timestamp. Rate limits apply per environment and role.

## Development Notes

### Adding New Admin Features
1. Add new permission to `AdminPermissions` enum
2. Create controller method with proper validation
3. Add route with appropriate middleware
4. Update frontend interface
5. Add audit logging for new actions

### Testing Admin Features
- Use admin test accounts with different permission levels
- Test permission boundaries and access control
- Verify audit logging for all admin actions
- Test error handling and edge cases

## Future Enhancements

  }
}

Retraining Flow
- POST /api/admin/ml/models/price/retrain triggers ETL + training synchronously and returns updated model record with metrics.
- Metrics include at least:
  - rows: number of training rows generated
  - r2: training set RÂ² approximation
