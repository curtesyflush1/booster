## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ 
- **Docker** and Docker Compose
- **Git**

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/curtesyflush1/booster.git
   cd booster
   ```

2. **Run the setup script**
   ```bash
   chmod +x scripts/setup-dev.sh
   ./scripts/setup-dev.sh
   ```

3. **Start development servers**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The setup script will:
- Install all dependencies
- Start Docker services (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Run database migrations
- Seed development data
- Run initial tests

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment files
cp .env.example .env
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env

# Start Docker services
npm run docker:dev

# Run database migrations
npm run migrate:up

# Seed development data
npm run seed:dev

# Start development servers
npm run dev
```

## üß™ Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run integration tests (requires Docker services)
npm run test:integration

# Run backend tests only
npm run test:backend

# Run frontend tests only
npm run test:frontend

# Run extension tests only
npm run test:extension

# Run smoke tests only
npm run test -- tests/smoke.test.ts
```

### Test Requirements

- **Docker services must be running** for integration tests
- **PostgreSQL test database** on port 5435
- **Redis** on port 6380
- Current test coverage: **48% statements, 75% functions** (will increase as features are added)
- Target coverage: **90%+ for production** (currently adjusted for early development)

## üê≥ Docker Commands

```bash
# Start development environment
npm run docker:dev

# Build and start (rebuild containers)
npm run docker:dev:build

# View logs
npm run docker:dev:logs

# Stop services
npm run docker:dev:down
```

## üìä Database Management

```bash
# Run migrations
npm run migrate:up

# Rollback migrations
npm run migrate:down

# Seed development data
npm run seed:dev

# Backup database
npm run db:backup
```

## üöÄ Production Deployment

The application uses PM2 for production process management with the following configuration:

### PM2 Configuration
- **Cluster mode**: Utilizes all available CPU cores
- **Auto-restart**: Restarts on crashes with exponential backoff
- **Memory management**: Restarts if memory usage exceeds 1GB
- **Logging**: Structured logs with timestamps in `./logs/` directory
- **Health monitoring**: Minimum uptime requirements and restart limits

### Deployment Process
```bash
# Deploy to production (full pipeline)
./scripts/deploy.sh

# Quick deployment options
./scripts/deploy.sh sync-only    # Only sync files
./scripts/deploy.sh restart-only # Only restart services
./scripts/deploy.sh check        # Health check only
./scripts/deploy.sh rollback     # Rollback to previous release
```

The deployment script performs:
1. **Pre-deployment checks** - Tests and build validation
2. **Atomic deployment** - Zero-downtime release switching
3. **Database migrations** - Automatic schema updates
4. **Health verification** - Post-deployment validation
5. **Cleanup** - Maintains last 5 releases for rollback

### Production Commands
```bash
# Check PM2 status
pm2 status

# View application logs
pm2 logs booster-beacon-api

# Restart application
pm2 restart booster-beacon-api

# Monitor in real-time
pm2 monit
```
