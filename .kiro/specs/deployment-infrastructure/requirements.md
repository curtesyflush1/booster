# Deployment Infrastructure Requirements

## Introduction

This spec focuses on creating a robust, automated deployment infrastructure for the BoosterBeacon application. The goal is to establish a reliable development-to-production pipeline that enables safe, fast deployments with proper rollback capabilities, monitoring, and disaster recovery. The system should support a Linux development environment deploying to a remote VPS with minimal manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL use npm ci for reproducible production builds
2. WHEN syncing code THEN the system SHALL exclude node_modules and install fresh dependencies on server
3. WHEN dependencies fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and halt deployment
4. WHEN backend builds THEN the system SHALL compile TypeScript and create production-ready JavaScript
5. WHEN dependencies install THEN the system SHALL only install production dependencies to minimize attack surface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want database migration automation, so that schema changes are applied safely during deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying with schema changes THEN the system SHALL run database migrations automatically
2. WHEN migrations fail THEN the system SHALL halt deployment and provide rollback instructions
3. WHEN migrations succeed THEN the system SHALL continue with application deployment
4. WHEN rollback occurs THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on database rollback procedures
5. WHEN migrations run THEN the system SHALL backup database before applying changes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive health monitoring, so that I can verify deployments are successful and catch issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployment completes THEN the system SHALL check HTTP health endpoints automatically
2. WHEN services start THEN the system SHALL verify PM2 processes are running correctly
3. WHEN health checks fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and logs
4. WHEN monitoring system health THEN the system SHALL check database connectivity and external service availability
5. WHEN issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide actionable troubleshooting information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want secure credential management, so that sensitive information is protected in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
2. WHEN storing secrets THEN the system SHALL never commit credentials to version control
3. WHEN accessing databases THEN the system SHALL use secure connection strings with proper authentication
4. WHEN configuring services THEN the system SHALL use least-privilege access principles
5. WHEN managing API keys THEN the system SHALL provide secure storage and rotation capabilities

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated backup and disaster recovery, so that data is protected and recoverable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running in production THEN the system SHALL perform automated daily database backups
2. WHEN backups are created THEN the system SHALL verify backup integrity and test restore procedures
3. WHEN disaster occurs THEN the system SHALL provide documented recovery procedures
4. WHEN backups age THEN the system SHALL implement retention policies and cleanup old backups
5. WHEN critical data changes THEN the system SHALL support point-in-time recovery capabilities

### Requirement 10

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN applications run THEN the system SHALL provide structured JSON logging with correlation IDs
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error information and stack traces
3. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track response times, error rates, and throughput
4. WHEN analyzing issues THEN the system SHALL provide centralized log aggregation and search
5. WHEN alerts are needed THEN the system SHALL support configurable alerting for critical issues

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want staging environment support, so that I can test deployments before production.
