# BoosterBeacon Code Improvement Checklist

This checklist is based on a deep-dive analysis of the BoosterBeacon repository. It is designed to provide actionable steps to enhance the security, efficiency, and maintainability of the application.

## Ⅰ. Backend Improvements (`/backend`)

### 🛡️ Security (High Priority)

* **Authentication & Authorization**
    * [x] **Implement Token Revocation:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive Redis-based token blacklist system implemented with TokenBlacklistService for immediate JWT token invalidation
    * [x] **Enhance Session Management:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Password changes and security events now invalidate all user sessions by revoking all existing tokens
    * [x] **Implement Granular RBAC:** Move beyond simple subscription tiers to a more robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with specific permissions for different user roles (e.g., `can_delete_users`, `can_view_system_stats`), especially for admin routes.

* **Credential Management**
    * [x] **Integrate a Key Management Service (KMS):** For production, replace the static `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from environment variables with a dedicated service like AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, or HashiCorp Vault to manage encryption keys securely.
    * [x] **Consider Per-User Encryption Keys:** For maximum security, investigate deriving unique encryption keys for each user based on their password to protect retailer credentials even if the main database is compromised.

* **Input Validation & Sanitization**
    * [x] **Standardize Validation with Joi:** Refactor all controllers to consistently use Joi schemas for request validation, enforcing this pattern with a middleware.
    * [x] **Sanitize All URL Parameters:** Explicitly sanitize all user-provided input from URL parameters (like `setName` in `productController.ts`) before they are used in database queries to prevent any potential SQL injection vectors.

---

### ⚡ Efficiency & Performance (Medium Priority)

* **Database Optimization**
    * [x] **Enforce Pagination Globally:** Modify the `BaseModel` or create a new standard to ensure all database queries that can return multiple rows are paginated by default to prevent performance degradation with large datasets.
    * [x] **Optimize `getUserAlertStats` Query:** Refactor the `Alert.getUserAlertStats` method to use a single, more complex SQL query with aggregations and window functions to reduce database round trips.
    * [x] **Combine `getProductById` Queries:** In `productController.ts`, combine the two separate database calls in `getProductById` and `getProductBySlug` (one for the product, one for availability) into a single query using a `JOIN`.

* **Caching Strategy**
    * [x] **Implement Distributed Caching:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Advanced Redis caching system implemented with JSON serialization, cache-or-fetch patterns, and type-safe operations

---

### 🧹 Code Quality & Maintainability (Medium Priority)

* **Validation System** ✅ **COMPLETED (August 28, 2025)**
    * [x] **Standardize Validation with Joi:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Refactored all controllers to consistently use Joi schemas for request validation, enforcing this pattern with centralized middleware
    * [x] **Fix Schema Compilation Issues:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Resolved Joi schema caching and compilation problems
    * [x] **Update Route Validation:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Migrated all routes to use `validateJoi`, `validateJoiBody`, `validateJoiQuery`, `validateJoiParams`
    * [x] **Standardize Error Responses:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented consistent validation error format with field-level details
    * [x] **Performance Optimization:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Added schema caching for improved validation performance

* **Code Duplication**
    * [x] **Create a `BaseRetailerService`:** Abstract the common logic found in the individual retailer services (`BestBuyService.ts`, `WalmartService.ts`, etc.) into a `BaseRetailerService` class to reduce code duplication and simplify adding new retailers.

* **Error Handling**
    * [x] **Standardize Validation Error Classes:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented `ValidationErrorHandler` with consistent error formatting and logging
    * [x] **Add More Context to Error Logs:** Enhance the `errorHandler` middleware and general logging to include more context in error messages, such as stack traces, method names, and request IDs, to facilitate easier debugging.

* **Refactoring**
    * [x] **Refactor Long Methods:** Break down long methods like `getDashboardStats` in `adminSystemService.ts` into smaller, single-responsibility functions (`getUserStatistics`, `getAlertStatistics`, etc.) to improve readability and testability.
    * [x] **Extract Magic Numbers to Constants:** Remove hardcoded "magic numbers" (e.g., `60000` for intervals) and replace them with named constants to make the code more self-documenting and easier to maintain.
    * [x] **Consider Dependency Injection:** For better testability, consider refactoring services to accept dependencies (like the database connection) via their constructor instead of relying on static methods like `BaseModel.getKnex()`.

---

## Ⅱ. Frontend Improvements (`/frontend`)

### 🛡️ Security (Medium Priority)

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    * [x] **Implement Content Sanitization:** If you plan to display any user-generated content, ensure it is sanitized on the backend before being stored and rendered on the frontend to prevent XSS attacks.

---

### ⚡ Efficiency & Performance (Medium Priority)

* **API Requests**
    * [x] **Consolidate Dashboard API Calls:** Create a dedicated backend endpoint to aggregate all the data required for the `DashboardPage`, reducing the number of initial API requests from multiple to a single call.
    * [x] **Analyze Bundle Size:** Use a tool like `vite-plugin-visualizer` to inspect the production bundle and identify opportunities for further code splitting, especially for large components.

* **Rendering Performance**
    * [x] **Use Memoization:** For components that are re-rendered frequently with the same props, apply `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve UI performance.

---

### 🧹 Code Quality & Maintainability (Low Priority)

* **State Management**
    * [x] **Evaluate Advanced State Management:** As the application grows, if you notice prop-drilling or overly complex Context providers, evaluate the need for a more robust state management library like Redux Toolkit or Zustand.

---

## Ⅲ. Browser Extension Improvements (`/extension`)

### 🛡️ Security (High Priority)

* **Permissions**
    * [x] **Regularly Audit Permissions:** Periodically review the permissions requested in `manifest.chrome.json` to ensure the extension only asks for what is absolutely necessary for its functionality.

* **Content Scripts**
    * [x] **Isolate Content Script Scope:** Ensure that the content script does not leak any variables or functions into the global scope of the web pages it runs on to avoid conflicts and potential security issues.

---

### ⚡ Efficiency & Performance (Medium Priority)

* **Background Script**
    * [x] **Optimize Background Tasks:** Continue to use `chrome.alarms` for periodic tasks instead of `setInterval`. Ensure that any processing in the background script is lightweight and efficient to minimize impact on the user's browser performance.
# BoosterBeacon Final Refinements Checklist

This checklist contains the final set of improvements for the BoosterBeacon application, focusing on logic refinement, performance tuning, and hardening against edge cases.

---

### **Backend (`/backend`)**

* [X] **1. Prevent Race Condition in Alert Generation**
    * **File:** `backend/src/services/alertProcessingService.ts`
    * **Task:** Refactor the `generateAlert` function to prevent a race condition where duplicate alerts could be created.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Locate the `generateAlert` method.
        2.  Wrap the `checkForDuplicates` call and the `Alert.createAlert` call within a single database transaction using `BaseModel.getKnex().transaction()`.
        3.  Use the transaction object (`trx`) for all database operations within the block.
        4.  Ensure the transaction is committed upon success and rolled back upon failure.

* [X] **2. Optimize Rate Limit Check Query**
    * **File:** `backend/src/services/alertProcessingService.ts`
    * **Task:** Improve the efficiency of the `checkRateLimits` function by performing the count in the database instead of in memory.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  In the `checkRateLimits` function, remove the call that fetches all recent alerts (`Alert.findBy`).
        2.  Replace it with a Knex query that directly counts the number of alerts for the given `userId` created in the last hour.
        3.  The query should look like: `const result = await Alert.db('alerts').where('user_id', userId).where('created_at', '>=', oneHourAgo).count('* as count').first();`
        4.  Use the count from the result to check against the rate limit.

* [X] **3. Add Context to Retailer Integration Error Logs**
    * **File:** `backend/src/services/RetailerIntegrationService.ts`
    * **Task:** Enhance the error logging in `checkAllRetailersForProduct` to include the ID of the failing retailer.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  In the `checkAllRetailersForProduct` method, find the `if (result.status === 'rejected')` block inside the loop.
        2.  Modify the `logger.error` call within this block to include the `retailer.id` in the metadata object. Example: `logger.error('...', { retailerId: retailer.id, ... });`

---

### **Frontend (`/frontend`)**

* [X] **4. Implement Granular Data Fetching on Dashboard**
    * **File:** `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`
    * **Task:** Refactor the data fetching logic to prevent redundant API calls when filters change.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Split the single `useEffect` hook that fetches all dashboard data into multiple `useEffect` hooks.
        2.  Create one `useEffect` for each of the three main data types: `dashboardData`, `portfolioData`, and `predictiveInsights`.
        3.  Ensure each `useEffect` has only the specific filter properties it depends on in its dependency array. For example, if `portfolioData` is not affected by filters, its `useEffect` should have an empty dependency array `[]` so it only runs once.

* [X] **5. Add Optimistic UI to Product Card "Watch" Button**
    * **File:** `frontend/src/components/products/ProductCard.tsx`
    * **Task:** Improve the user experience by immediately updating the UI when a user clicks the "Watch" button.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Introduce a local state variable, e.g., `const [isWatching, setIsWatching] = useState(false);`.
        2.  In the `handleAddWatch` function, immediately call `setIsWatching(true)`.
        3.  After this, make the API call to add the product to the watch list.
        4.  If the API call fails, call `setIsWatching(false)` in the `.catch()` block and show an error notification.
        5.  Update the button's appearance based on the `isWatching` state (e.g., change text to "Watching", change color, show a checkmark icon).

# BoosterBeacon Backend: Final Test Suite Cleanup

This checklist provides the final, targeted instructions to resolve all remaining test failures in the last 8 services, with the goal of achieving a 100% green test suite.

---

### **


* [ ] **2. Align Mocks in `TokenBlacklistService`**
    * **File:** `backend/tests/services/tokenBlacklistService.test.ts`
    * **Task:** The tests for this service are failing due to mock expectation mismatches, likely with the Redis mock. Update the test mocks to align with the service's actual logic.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Run the `tokenBlacklistService.test.ts` file to isolate the failures.
        2.  For each failing test, look at the mock Redis calls (e.g., `mockRedis.sAdd.mockResolvedValue(...)`).
        3.  Compare the test's expectations with the actual implementation in `tokenBlacklistService.ts` and update the test to match the real logic.

* [ ] **3. Fix Logic in `QuietHoursFiltering`**
    * **File:** `backend/tests/services/quietHoursFiltering.test.ts`
    * **Task:** These tests are failing due to business logic issues. Debug the `isQuietTime` method in `quietHoursService.ts` to ensure it correctly handles all test case scenarios.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Run the `quietHoursFiltering.test.ts` file to see the specific failures.
        2.  For a failing test, use `console.log` or a debugger inside the `isQuietTime` method in `quietHoursService.ts` to trace the execution.
        3.  Identify and correct the logical error in the time comparison or timezone handling that is causing the test to fail.

### **Phase 2: Final Infrastructure and Import Fixes**

* [ ] **4. Resolve `UserCredentialService` Encryption Issues**
    * **File:** `backend/tests/services/userCredentialService.test.ts`
    * **Task:** The tests for this service are failing due to encryption logic that depends on the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable. Ensure this is being handled correctly.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Confirm that the `backend/.env.test` file contains a valid 32-character string for `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
        2.  Ensure that the Jest setup (`jest.setup.js`) is correctly loading the environment variables from this file.
        3.  Debug the `userCredentialService.test.ts` file to see if the encryption/decryption functions are throwing errors and fix the underlying logic if necessary.

* [ ] **5. Fix `WebSocketService` Import/Constructor**
    * **File:** `backend/tests/services/websocketService.test.ts`
    * **Task:** Fix the final import or instantiation issue causing the `WebSocketService` tests to fail.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Open `backend/tests/services/websocketService.test.ts`.
        2.  Ensure the `WebSocketService` class is properly exported from `backend/src/services/websocketService.ts`.
        3.  The service's constructor likely requires an HTTP server instance. Ensure the test is creating a mock server and passing it during instantiation: `const mockServer = http.createServer(); const service = new WebSocketService(mockServer);`.

# BoosterBeacon: Heuristic ML Model Implementation Checklist

This checklist implements a `ModelRunner` interface and a simple heuristic-based model to replace the mock data in the `dashboardService`, providing more realistic predictive insights.

---

### **Phase 1: Create the Model Runner and Heuristic Logic**

* **1. Create the `ModelRunner` Interface**
    * **File:** `backend/src/services/ml/IModelRunner.ts` (Create this new file and directory).
    * **Task:** Define the contract for all future model runners.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Create a new directory: `backend/src/services/ml`.
        2.  Create a new file `IModelRunner.ts` inside it.
        3.  Define and export an interface `IModelRunner` with a single method, `predict`, that takes a product ID and returns a promise resolving to the `MLPrediction` type.

* **2. Implement the Heuristic Model**
    * **File:** `backend/src/services/ml/HeuristicModelRunner.ts` (Create this new file).
    * **Task:** Create a simple model that implements the `IModelRunner` interface and generates predictions based on heuristics.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Create a new file `HeuristicModelRunner.ts` in `backend/src/services/ml`.
        2.  Create a class `HeuristicModelRunner` that implements `IModelRunner`.
        3.  Implement the `predict` method. Inside this method:
            * Fetch the product's price history and popularity score.
            * **Price Forecast:** Implement a simple trend calculation based on the last 7 days of price history.
            * **Sellout Risk:** Calculate a score based on the product's `popularity_score` and the number of recent alerts.
            * **ROI Estimate & Hype Score:** For now, these can remain as well-reasoned, non-random placeholder values.
        4.  Return the data in the shape of the `MLPrediction` type.

### **Phase 2: Integrate the New Model**

* **3. Create a `ModelFactory`**
    * **File:** `backend/src/services/ml/ModelFactory.ts` (Create this new file).
    * **Task:** Create a factory that can provide the currently active model runner.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Create a new file `ModelFactory.ts` in `backend/src/services/ml`.
        2.  Create a `ModelFactory` class with a static method `getActiveRunner(): IModelRunner`.
        3.  For now, this method will simply return a new instance of your `HeuristicModelRunner`. In the future, it can be updated to load a real model from the database.

* **4. Update the `DashboardService`**
    * **File:** `backend/src/services/dashboardService.ts`
    * **Task:** Replace the mock data generation with a call to the new `ModelFactory`.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Open `backend/src/services/dashboardService.ts`.
        2.  Import the `ModelFactory` from `../services/ml/ModelFactory`.
        3.  Locate the `generateProductInsights` method.
        4.  Remove the existing block of code that generates random, mock data.
        5.  Get the active model runner: `const modelRunner = ModelFactory.getActiveRunner();`
        6.  Call the runner to get the prediction: `const prediction = await modelRunner.predict(productId);`
        7.  Return the prediction.

# BoosterBeacon: "My Watches" Page Performance Optimization

This checklist implements a new batch-fetching endpoint on the backend and refactors the frontend Watches page to use it, eliminating the N+1 query problem.

---

### **Phase 1: Backend Implementation**

* [X] **1. Create the New `by-ids` Route**
    * **File:** `backend/src/routes/products.ts`
    * **Task:** Add a new route to handle fetching multiple products by their IDs. A `POST` route is preferred for sending a list of IDs.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Open `backend/src/routes/products.ts`.
        2.  Add a new route definition: `router.post('/by-ids', productController.getProductsByIds);`

* [X] **2. Implement the `getProductsByIds` Controller**
    * **File:** `backend/src/controllers/productController.ts`
    * **Task:** Create the controller logic to handle the new route.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Open `backend/src/controllers/productController.ts`.
        2.  Create a new exported function `getProductsByIds`.
        3.  The function should expect a JSON body containing an array of product IDs, e.g., `{ ids: ['id1', 'id2', ...] }`.
        4.  Validate the input to ensure `ids` is an array of strings.
        5.  Call a new method on the `Product` model/repository (e.g., `Product.findByIds(ids)`) to fetch the data.
        6.  Return the list of products as a JSON response.

* [ ] **3. Implement the `findByIds` Model/Repository Method**
    * **File:** `backend/src/models/Product.ts` (or `backend/src/repositories/ProductRepository.ts` if you are using the repository pattern).
    * **Task:** Create the database logic to fetch multiple products efficiently.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Open the `Product.ts` model file.
        2.  Create a new static method `findByIds(ids: string[])`.
        3.  Inside this method, use a single Knex query with a `whereIn` clause to fetch all products whose IDs are in the provided `ids` array.
        4.  **Example Query:** `return this.db(this.getTableName()).whereIn('id', ids);`

### **Phase 2: Frontend Refactoring**

* [ ] **4. Refactor the `WatchesPage` Component**
    * **File:** `frontend/src/pages/WatchesPage.tsx`
    * **Task:** Update the data fetching logic to use the new, efficient batch endpoint.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Modify the data fetching logic in `WatchesPage.tsx`. The new flow should be:
        2.  **First,** fetch the user's list of watches from `GET /api/watches`. This response will contain `watch` objects, each with a `product_id`.
        3.  **Then,** extract all the `product_id`s from the list of watches into a new array.
        4.  **Finally,** make a *single* `POST` request to the new `/api/products/by-ids` endpoint, sending the array of product IDs in the request body.
        5.  Use the product data returned from this second call to render your `ProductGrid`.

# BoosterBeacon: Test Suite Stabilization Checklist

This checklist resolves the core test environment and test code issues to achieve a stable and passing integration test suite.

---

### **Phase 1: Fix the Test Environment**

* [] **1. Automate Test Database Migrations**
    * **File:** `backend/tests/integration/setup.ts`
    * **Task:** Modify the Jest setup file to automatically run database migrations and seeds before any integration tests are executed.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Import your `knex` instance at the top of the file.
        2.  Create a `beforeAll` block.
        3.  Inside the `beforeAll`, add the following asynchronous calls:
            * `await knex.migrate.latest();`
            * `await knex.seed.run();`
        4.  Create an `afterAll` block to clean up the connection: `await knex.destroy();`.

* [ ] **2. Harden the Teardown Logic**
    * **File:** `backend/tests/integration/setup.ts`
    * **Task:** Make the `afterEach` table truncation logic more resilient.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Wrap the existing `TRUNCATE` logic inside a `try/catch` block to prevent it from crashing the entire suite if a table doesn't exist.
        2.  Alternatively, query the database to get a list of all tables and then dynamically generate the `TRUNCATE` command.

### **Phase 2: Fix the Test Code**

* [ ] **3. Fix Service Mocking Patterns**
    * **File:** `backend/tests/integration/retailerIntegration.test.ts` (and any other affected files).
    * **Task:** Correctly mock the service classes to resolve the ".mockImplementation is not a function" errors.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  At the top of the test file, add explicit mock declarations for each service being tested.
        2.  **Example:** `jest.mock('../../src/services/retailers/BestBuyService');`

* [ ] **4. Fix Test TypeScript Errors**
    * **File:** `backend/tests/integration/auth.test.ts` (and other affected files).
    * **Task:** Correct invalid syntax and update mock data structures.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  In `auth.test.ts`, find the invalid assignment `const tokens = await authService.generateTokens = jest.fn()`.
        2.  Replace it with `const generateTokensSpy = jest.spyOn(authService, 'generateTokens').mockResolvedValue(...);`.
        3.  Perform a search across the `backend/tests` directory for `IUser` mocks and ensure they include the new required fields (`role`, `admin_permissions`, etc.).

# BoosterBeacon: Event-Driven Transaction & Billing System MVP

This checklist implements the foundational data models and services for a unified, event-driven transaction system that will power analytics and machine learning.

---

### **Phase 1: The Transactional Foundation**

* [ ] **1. Create the New Database Tables**
    * **Task:** Create new database migration files to add the `transactions` and `billing_events` tables to your schema.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Create a new migration file in `backend/migrations/`.
        2.  In this file, define the schema for the `transactions` table as you've outlined (id, product_id, retailer_slug, user_id_hash, status, price_paid, etc.). Ensure you add appropriate indexes on `user_id_hash`, `product_id`, and `retailer_slug`.
        3.  Create another migration for the `billing_events` table with its corresponding schema (id, stripe_customer_id, event_type, etc.), with an index on `stripe_customer_id`.

* [ ] **2. Scaffold the `TransactionService` and Event Bus**
    * **Files:** A new `backend/src/services/transactionService.ts` and `backend/src/services/eventBusService.ts`.
    * **Task:** Create the core service for recording transaction events and a simple, Redis-based event bus for emitting them.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  **Create `EventBusService`:** In this new service, create a simple `emit` method that uses your existing Redis service to `XADD` a new event to a Redis Stream. The event payload should be a JSON string of the event data.
        2.  **Create `TransactionService`:** This service will have methods like `recordPurchaseAttempt`, `recordPurchaseSuccess`, and `recordPurchaseFailure`.
        3.  Each method in `TransactionService` should do two things:
            * Persist the data to the new `transactions` table in the main Postgres database.
            * Use the `EventBusService` to emit the full event to your Redis Stream.

### **Phase 2: Integrate the Event Hooks**

* [ ] **3. Integrate `TransactionService` into the Purchase Orchestrator**
    * **File:** `backend/src/services/PurchaseOrchestrator.ts` (or your equivalent auto-buy worker).
    * **Task:** Modify your existing auto-buy worker to call the new `TransactionService` at each stage of the purchase process.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Before a purchase attempt, call `transactionService.recordPurchaseAttempt(...)`.
        2.  On a successful purchase, call `transactionService.recordPurchaseSuccess(...)`.
        3.  On a failed purchase, call `transactionService.recordPurchaseFailure(...)`, making sure to include the `failure_reason`.

* [ ] **4. Integrate Stripe Webhooks with the Event Bus**
    * **File:** `backend/src/controllers/subscriptionController.ts` (or wherever your Stripe webhook handler is).
    * **Task:** In addition to updating the user's subscription status, the Stripe webhook handler should now also record the event to the `billing_events` table and emit it to the event bus.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  In your Stripe webhook handler, after verifying the event, create a payload that matches the `billing_events` schema.
        2.  Persist this payload to the `billing_events` table.
        3.  Use the `EventBusService` to emit the billing event to your Redis Stream.

# BoosterBeacon: Purchase Orchestrator Stub Implementation

This checklist implements a minimal, placeholder `PurchaseOrchestrator` to demonstrate and validate the end-to-end purchase event recording pipeline.

---

* [ ] **1. Create the `PurchaseOrchestrator` Service**
    * **File:** `backend/src/services/PurchaseOrchestrator.ts` (Create this new file).
    * **Task:** Create a stubbed orchestrator service that simulates the purchase process and calls the `TransactionService`.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Create the new `PurchaseOrchestrator.ts` service file.
        2.  Import the `transactionService` singleton.
        3.  Create a `PurchaseOrchestrator` class with a single public method: `async executePurchase(job: PurchaseJob)`. The `PurchaseJob` type should include `userId`, `productId`, `retailerId`, etc.
        4.  Inside `executePurchase`, implement the following logic:
            * Call `transactionService.recordPurchaseAttempt(...)` immediately.
            * Use a `setTimeout` of 1-2 seconds to simulate the time it takes to perform a checkout.
            * Use a simple `Math.random()` to simulate either a success or a failure.
            * If it "succeeds," call `transactionService.recordPurchaseSuccess(...)`.
            * If it "fails," call `transactionService.recordPurchaseFailure(...)` with a sample failure reason like "SIMULATED_OUT_OF_STOCK".

* [ ] **2. Create a Simple Job Queue and Worker**
    * **File:** `backend/src/services/PurchaseQueue.ts` (Create this new file).
    * **Task:** Create a very simple in-memory queue and a worker that pulls jobs from it and passes them to the orchestrator.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Create the new `PurchaseQueue.ts` service file.
        2.  Create a simple array to act as the in-memory queue.
        3.  Create an `addJob(job: PurchaseJob)` function that pushes a job to the array.
        4.  Create a `startWorker()` function that uses `setInterval` to check the queue every 5 seconds.
        5.  If a job is found in the queue, it should pull it off and call `PurchaseOrchestrator.executePurchase(job)`.
        6.  Call `startWorker()` from your main `backend/src/index.ts` file to start the process.

* [ ] **3. Create a Test Route to Trigger a Purchase**
    * **File:** `backend/src/routes/admin.ts` (or a new test route file).
    * **Task:** Add a temporary, admin-only route to easily trigger a test purchase job.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Add a new route, e.g., `POST /api/admin/test-purchase`.
        2.  The controller for this route should call the `PurchaseQueue.addJob(...)` function with some hardcoded test data.
        3.  This will allow you to easily test the entire flow by hitting the endpoint with a tool like `curl`.
