# BoosterBeacon Code Improvement Checklist

This checklist is based on a deep-dive analysis of the BoosterBeacon repository. It is designed to provide actionable steps to enhance the security, efficiency, and maintainability of the application.

## Ⅰ. Backend Improvements (`/backend`)

### 🛡️ Security (High Priority)

* **Authentication & Authorization**
    * [x] **Implement Token Revocation:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive Redis-based token blacklist system implemented with TokenBlacklistService for immediate JWT token invalidation
    * [x] **Enhance Session Management:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Password changes and security events now invalidate all user sessions by revoking all existing tokens
    * [x] **Implement Granular RBAC:** Move beyond simple subscription tiers to a more robust Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system with specific permissions for different user roles (e.g., `can_delete_users`, `can_view_system_stats`), especially for admin routes.

* **Credential Management**
    * [x] **Integrate a Key Management Service (KMS):** For production, replace the static `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from environment variables with a dedicated service like AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, or HashiCorp Vault to manage encryption keys securely.
    * [x] **Consider Per-User Encryption Keys:** For maximum security, investigate deriving unique encryption keys for each user based on their password to protect retailer credentials even if the main database is compromised.

* **Input Validation & Sanitization**
    * [x] **Standardize Validation with Joi:** Refactor all controllers to consistently use Joi schemas for request validation, enforcing this pattern with a middleware.
    * [x] **Sanitize All URL Parameters:** Explicitly sanitize all user-provided input from URL parameters (like `setName` in `productController.ts`) before they are used in database queries to prevent any potential SQL injection vectors.

---

### ⚡ Efficiency & Performance (Medium Priority)

* **Database Optimization**
    * [x] **Enforce Pagination Globally:** Modify the `BaseModel` or create a new standard to ensure all database queries that can return multiple rows are paginated by default to prevent performance degradation with large datasets.
    * [x] **Optimize `getUserAlertStats` Query:** Refactor the `Alert.getUserAlertStats` method to use a single, more complex SQL query with aggregations and window functions to reduce database round trips.
    * [x] **Combine `getProductById` Queries:** In `productController.ts`, combine the two separate database calls in `getProductById` and `getProductBySlug` (one for the product, one for availability) into a single query using a `JOIN`.

* **Caching Strategy**
    * [x] **Implement Distributed Caching:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Advanced Redis caching system implemented with JSON serialization, cache-or-fetch patterns, and type-safe operations

---

### 🧹 Code Quality & Maintainability (Medium Priority)

* **Validation System** ✅ **COMPLETED (August 28, 2025)**
    * [x] **Standardize Validation with Joi:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Refactored all controllers to consistently use Joi schemas for request validation, enforcing this pattern with centralized middleware
    * [x] **Fix Schema Compilation Issues:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Resolved Joi schema caching and compilation problems
    * [x] **Update Route Validation:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Migrated all routes to use `validateJoi`, `validateJoiBody`, `validateJoiQuery`, `validateJoiParams`
    * [x] **Standardize Error Responses:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented consistent validation error format with field-level details
    * [x] **Performance Optimization:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Added schema caching for improved validation performance

* **Code Duplication**
    * [x] **Create a `BaseRetailerService`:** Abstract the common logic found in the individual retailer services (`BestBuyService.ts`, `WalmartService.ts`, etc.) into a `BaseRetailerService` class to reduce code duplication and simplify adding new retailers.

* **Error Handling**
    * [x] **Standardize Validation Error Classes:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Implemented `ValidationErrorHandler` with consistent error formatting and logging
    * [x] **Add More Context to Error Logs:** Enhance the `errorHandler` middleware and general logging to include more context in error messages, such as stack traces, method names, and request IDs, to facilitate easier debugging.

* **Refactoring**
    * [x] **Refactor Long Methods:** Break down long methods like `getDashboardStats` in `adminSystemService.ts` into smaller, single-responsibility functions (`getUserStatistics`, `getAlertStatistics`, etc.) to improve readability and testability.
    * [x] **Extract Magic Numbers to Constants:** Remove hardcoded "magic numbers" (e.g., `60000` for intervals) and replace them with named constants to make the code more self-documenting and easier to maintain.
    * [x] **Consider Dependency Injection:** For better testability, consider refactoring services to accept dependencies (like the database connection) via their constructor instead of relying on static methods like `BaseModel.getKnex()`.

---

## Ⅱ. Frontend Improvements (`/frontend`)

### 🛡️ Security (Medium Priority)

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    * [x] **Implement Content Sanitization:** If you plan to display any user-generated content, ensure it is sanitized on the backend before being stored and rendered on the frontend to prevent XSS attacks.

---

### ⚡ Efficiency & Performance (Medium Priority)

* **API Requests**
    * [x] **Consolidate Dashboard API Calls:** Create a dedicated backend endpoint to aggregate all the data required for the `DashboardPage`, reducing the number of initial API requests from multiple to a single call.
    * [x] **Analyze Bundle Size:** Use a tool like `vite-plugin-visualizer` to inspect the production bundle and identify opportunities for further code splitting, especially for large components.

* **Rendering Performance**
    * [x] **Use Memoization:** For components that are re-rendered frequently with the same props, apply `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve UI performance.

---

### 🧹 Code Quality & Maintainability (Low Priority)

* **State Management**
    * [x] **Evaluate Advanced State Management:** As the application grows, if you notice prop-drilling or overly complex Context providers, evaluate the need for a more robust state management library like Redux Toolkit or Zustand.

---

## Ⅲ. Browser Extension Improvements (`/extension`)

### 🛡️ Security (High Priority)

* **Permissions**
    * [x] **Regularly Audit Permissions:** Periodically review the permissions requested in `manifest.chrome.json` to ensure the extension only asks for what is absolutely necessary for its functionality.

* **Content Scripts**
    * [x] **Isolate Content Script Scope:** Ensure that the content script does not leak any variables or functions into the global scope of the web pages it runs on to avoid conflicts and potential security issues.

---

### ⚡ Efficiency & Performance (Medium Priority)

* **Background Script**
    * [x] **Optimize Background Tasks:** Continue to use `chrome.alarms` for periodic tasks instead of `setInterval`. Ensure that any processing in the background script is lightweight and efficient to minimize impact on the user's browser performance.

### **Backend (`/backend`)**

* [X] **1. Prevent Race Condition in Alert Generation**
    * **File:** `backend/src/services/alertProcessingService.ts`
    * **Task:** Refactor the `generateAlert` function to prevent a race condition where duplicate alerts could be created.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Locate the `generateAlert` method.
        2.  Wrap the `checkForDuplicates` call and the `Alert.createAlert` call within a single database transaction using `BaseModel.getKnex().transaction()`.
        3.  Use the transaction object (`trx`) for all database operations within the block.
        4.  Ensure the transaction is committed upon success and rolled back upon failure.

* [X] **2. Optimize Rate Limit Check Query**
    * **File:** `backend/src/services/alertProcessingService.ts`
    * **Task:** Improve the efficiency of the `checkRateLimits` function by performing the count in the database instead of in memory.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  In the `checkRateLimits` function, remove the call that fetches all recent alerts (`Alert.findBy`).
        2.  Replace it with a Knex query that directly counts the number of alerts for the given `userId` created in the last hour.
        3.  The query should look like: `const result = await Alert.db('alerts').where('user_id', userId).where('created_at', '>=', oneHourAgo).count('* as count').first();`
        4.  Use the count from the result to check against the rate limit.

* [X] **3. Add Context to Retailer Integration Error Logs**
    * **File:** `backend/src/services/RetailerIntegrationService.ts`
    * **Task:** Enhance the error logging in `checkAllRetailersForProduct` to include the ID of the failing retailer.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  In the `checkAllRetailersForProduct` method, find the `if (result.status === 'rejected')` block inside the loop.
        2.  Modify the `logger.error` call within this block to include the `retailer.id` in the metadata object. Example: `logger.error('...', { retailerId: retailer.id, ... });`

---

### **Frontend (`/frontend`)**

* [X] **4. Implement Granular Data Fetching on Dashboard**
    * **File:** `frontend/src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx`
    * **Task:** Refactor the data fetching logic to prevent redundant API calls when filters change.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Split the single `useEffect` hook that fetches all dashboard data into multiple `useEffect` hooks.
        2.  Create one `useEffect` for each of the three main data types: `dashboardData`, `portfolioData`, and `predictiveInsights`.
        3.  Ensure each `useEffect` has only the specific filter properties it depends on in its dependency array. For example, if `portfolioData` is not affected by filters, its `useEffect` should have an empty dependency array `[]` so it only runs once.

* [X] **5. Add Optimistic UI to Product Card "Watch" Button**
    * **File:** `frontend/src/components/products/ProductCard.tsx`
    * **Task:** Improve the user experience by immediately updating the UI when a user clicks the "Watch" button.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Introduce a local state variable, e.g., `const [isWatching, setIsWatching] = useState(false);`.
        2.  In the `handleAddWatch` function, immediately call `setIsWatching(true)`.
        3.  After this, make the API call to add the product to the watch list.
        4.  If the API call fails, call `setIsWatching(false)` in the `.catch()` block and show an error notification.
        5.  Update the button's appearance based on the `isWatching` state (e.g., change text to "Watching", change color, show a checkmark icon).

# BoosterBeacon Backend: Final Test Suite Cleanup

This checklist provides the final, targeted instructions to resolve all remaining test failures in the last 8 services, with the goal of achieving a 100% green test suite.

---

### **


* [ ] **2. Align Mocks in `TokenBlacklistService`**
    * **File:** `backend/tests/services/tokenBlacklistService.test.ts`
    * **Task:** The tests for this service are failing due to mock expectation mismatches, likely with the Redis mock. Update the test mocks to align with the service's actual logic.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Run the `tokenBlacklistService.test.ts` file to isolate the failures.
        2.  For each failing test, look at the mock Redis calls (e.g., `mockRedis.sAdd.mockResolvedValue(...)`).
        3.  Compare the test's expectations with the actual implementation in `tokenBlacklistService.ts` and update the test to match the real logic.

* [ ] **3. Fix Logic in `QuietHoursFiltering`**
    * **File:** `backend/tests/services/quietHoursFiltering.test.ts`
    * **Task:** These tests are failing due to business logic issues. Debug the `isQuietTime` method in `quietHoursService.ts` to ensure it correctly handles all test case scenarios.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Run the `quietHoursFiltering.test.ts` file to see the specific failures.
        2.  For a failing test, use `console.log` or a debugger inside the `isQuietTime` method in `quietHoursService.ts` to trace the execution.
        3.  Identify and correct the logical error in the time comparison or timezone handling that is causing the test to fail.

### **Phase 2: Final Infrastructure and Import Fixes**

* [ ] **4. Resolve `UserCredentialService` Encryption Issues**
    * **File:** `backend/tests/services/userCredentialService.test.ts`
    * **Task:** The tests for this service are failing due to encryption logic that depends on the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable. Ensure this is being handled correctly.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Confirm that the `backend/.env.test` file contains a valid 32-character string for `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.
        2.  Ensure that the Jest setup (`jest.setup.js`) is correctly loading the environment variables from this file.
        3.  Debug the `userCredentialService.test.ts` file to see if the encryption/decryption functions are throwing errors and fix the underlying logic if necessary.

* [ ] **5. Fix `WebSocketService` Import/Constructor**
    * **File:** `backend/tests/services/websocketService.test.ts`
    * **Task:** Fix the final import or instantiation issue causing the `WebSocketService` tests to fail.
    * **Instructions:**
        1.  Open `backend/tests/services/websocketService.test.ts`.
        2.  Ensure the `WebSocketService` class is properly exported from `backend/src/services/websocketService.ts`.
        3.  The service's constructor likely requires an HTTP server instance. Ensure the test is creating a mock server and passing it during instantiation: `const mockServer = http.createServer(); const service = new WebSocketService(mockServer);`.
