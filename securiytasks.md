# BoosterBeacon Code Improvement Checklist

This checklist is based on a deep-dive analysis of the BoosterBeacon repository. It is designed to provide actionable steps to enhance the security, efficiency, and maintainability of the application.

## ‚Ö†. Backend Improvements (`/backend`)

### üõ°Ô∏è Security (High Priority)

* **Authentication & Authorization**
    * [x] **Implement Token Revocation:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Redis-based token blacklist system implemented with TokenBlacklistService for immediate JWT token invalidation on logout and password changes.
    * [x] **Enhance Session Management:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Password changes and security events automatically invalidate all user sessions with multi-device logout support.
    * [x] **Implement Granular RBAC:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive Role-Based Access Control system implemented with granular permissions for admin routes and user management.

* **Credential Management**
    * [ ] **Integrate a Key Management Service (KMS):** For production, replace the static `ENCRYPTION_KEY` from environment variables with a dedicated service like AWS KMS, Google Cloud KMS, or HashiCorp Vault to manage encryption keys securely.
    * [ ] **Consider Per-User Encryption Keys:** For maximum security, investigate deriving unique encryption keys for each user based on their password to protect retailer credentials even if the main database is compromised.

* **Input Validation & Sanitization**
    * [x] **Standardize Validation with Joi:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Successfully migrated all 80+ API endpoints to centralized Joi validation system with schema caching and 90%+ cache hit rate.
    * [x] **Sanitize All URL Parameters:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive parameter sanitization middleware implemented for all URL parameters, query strings, and request bodies to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

### ‚ö° Efficiency & Performance (Medium Priority)

* **Database Optimization**
    * [ ] **Enforce Pagination Globally:** Modify the `BaseModel` or create a new standard to ensure all database queries that can return multiple rows are paginated by default to prevent performance degradation with large datasets.
    * [ ] **Optimize `getUserAlertStats` Query:** Refactor the `Alert.getUserAlertStats` method to use a single, more complex SQL query with aggregations and window functions to reduce database round trips.
    * [ ] **Combine `getProductById` Queries:** In `productController.ts`, combine the two separate database calls in `getProductById` and `getProductBySlug` (one for the product, one for availability) into a single query using a `JOIN`.

* **Caching Strategy**
    * [ ] **Implement Distributed Caching:** Replace the current in-memory cache with a distributed cache like Redis (which is already in your `docker-compose.dev.yml`) to ensure cache consistency and scalability across multiple application instances.

---

### üßπ Code Quality & Maintainability (Medium Priority)

* **Code Duplication**
    * [ ] **Create a `BaseRetailerService`:** Abstract the common logic found in the individual retailer services (`BestBuyService.ts`, `WalmartService.ts`, etc.) into a `BaseRetailerService` class to reduce code duplication and simplify adding new retailers.

* **Error Handling**
    * [ ] **Standardize Custom Error Classes:** Define and consistently use a set of custom error classes (e.g., `ValidationError`, `AuthenticationError`, `NotFoundError`) throughout the application to make error handling more predictable and robust.
    * [ ] **Add More Context to Error Logs:** Enhance the `errorHandler` middleware and general logging to include more context in error messages, such as stack traces, method names, and request IDs, to facilitate easier debugging.

* **Refactoring**
    * [ ] **Refactor Long Methods:** Break down long methods like `getDashboardStats` in `adminSystemService.ts` into smaller, single-responsibility functions (`getUserStatistics`, `getAlertStatistics`, etc.) to improve readability and testability.
    * [ ] **Extract Magic Numbers to Constants:** Remove hardcoded "magic numbers" (e.g., `60000` for intervals) and replace them with named constants to make the code more self-documenting and easier to maintain.
    * [ ] **Consider Dependency Injection:** For better testability, consider refactoring services to accept dependencies (like the database connection) via their constructor instead of relying on static methods like `BaseModel.getKnex()`.

## ‚Ö°. Frontend Improvements (`/frontend`)

### üõ°Ô∏è Security (Medium Priority)

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    * [x] **Implement Content Sanitization:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Comprehensive HTML content sanitization system implemented with DOMPurify for all user-generated content, preventing XSS attacks with configurable sanitization rules for different content types.

---

### ‚ö° Efficiency & Performance (Medium Priority)

* **API Requests**
    * [ ] **Consolidate Dashboard API Calls:** Create a dedicated backend endpoint to aggregate all the data required for the `DashboardPage`, reducing the number of initial API requests from multiple to a single call.
    * [ ] **Analyze Bundle Size:** Use a tool like `vite-plugin-visualizer` to inspect the production bundle and identify opportunities for further code splitting, especially for large components.

* **Rendering Performance**
    * [ ] **Use Memoization:** For components that are re-rendered frequently with the same props, apply `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders and improve UI performance.

---

### üßπ Code Quality & Maintainability (Low Priority)

* **State Management**
    * [ ] **Evaluate Advanced State Management:** As the application grows, if you notice prop-drilling or overly complex Context providers, evaluate the need for a more robust state management library like Redux Toolkit or Zustand.

---

## ‚Ö¢. Browser Extension Improvements (`/extension`)

### üõ°Ô∏è Security (High Priority)

* **Permissions**
    * [ ] **Regularly Audit Permissions:** Periodically review the permissions requested in `manifest.chrome.json` to ensure the extension only asks for what is absolutely necessary for its functionality.

* **Content Scripts**
    * [ ] **Isolate Content Script Scope:** Ensure that the content script does not leak any variables or functions into the global scope of the web pages it runs on to avoid conflicts and potential security issues.

---

### ‚ö° Efficiency & Performance (Medium Priority)

* **Background Script**
    * [ ] **Optimize Background Tasks:** Continue to use `chrome.alarms` for periodic tasks instead of `setInterval`. Ensure that any processing in the background script is lightweight and efficient to minimize impact on the user's browser performance.
